# Subsequent conversation

 * Seems like there’s a roughly 1:1 ratio of “beginners” to “intermediates”. No self-proclaimed experts.
 * Web and UI: FP came in through the backdoor. Was in such a mess, was amenable to new paradigms.
 * Interest in concrete examples of how to integrate FP into a non-FP codebase.
 * Design patterns and how they map into or are replaced by FP concepts.
 * Maybe a 2:1 or 3:1 of beginner-to-expert talks?
 * Go through and dissect a particular FP library or application.
 * Take an FP architected application and explore it together as a group. (“Lay it out on the table”)
 * Connect with local academia. Have grad students, professors, undergrads come in and present results.
 * John Hughes, “Why Programming Matters”
 * Invited people to join us on #fp in the Chicago Tech Slack, and #chicago on the FP Slack.
 * There is a collection somewhere of “bad code” used for mob programming exercises. Could use it to mob-program FP.
 * Discussion of doing a multi-track approach, perhaps simultaneously. Do an advanced talk and a beginner talk, with shared social time.
 * General preference for hands-on learning over lots of talks.
 * Meet up again in January.
