# Functional Programming Meetup - Chicago

## Introductions

Your name and why you showed up today

## Brainstorm

* Two topics you would like to see a Meetup cover
  * If you see something you would be willing to give a talk on, now would be a good time to grab and run with it.

## Purpose(s)

* promote FP among Chicago developers
* resources and learning activities (many ask for FP intro day/course/talks)
* add yours

## Presentations

* Tech talks at meetup
  * Always good if you can get enough presenters
  * Requires continuous outreach
  * Need awareness of tech travellers (e.g. Conal Elliot, Conor McBride, Ed Kmett, Daniel Spiewak, Phil Wadler, for notable examples, all have talked at Sydney meetups on the way through town)

## Other Activities, workshops, etc.

Additional activities, variously, different levels as appropriate for beginner through expert

### Paper Club

Jeff Smith of Grubhub runs one for the DevOps group in Chicago

### Books

Read, work through, and discuss book for examples:

* "FP in Scala"
* "Haskell Prog from First Principles"
* Chris Okasaki's "Functional Data Structures"
* "Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming" (Mozart)

A good text provides many relevant exercises and examples. Knowledge does not come for free, you need to do the exercises and to keep up with the program to completion to profit by it.

In a group, this means that participants need to keep up with many other sources of pressure on their time. Not easy.

The benefit of the group, though, is that energy can be passed on, and questions answered, and blockages removed. But it takes motivation.

* Translate SICP to (Haskell, Scala, Elixir, ...)

Chris Rathman has started doing this translation into a variety of languages, including Haskell and Scala, as reported some years ago in LambdaTheUltimate. He also reports that Martin Odersky used many examples from SICP in his Scala teaching.

### Video series

"Let's Lens" - workshop and class (YouTube)

### Classes

* Motivation for FP
* Introduction to FP in general, or a particular language
* External classes - work together
  * Coursera: Odersky et al. Scala course
  * Tony Morris "Let's Lens"
  * NICTA Haskell (Tony Morris, Mark Hibberd)
  * "Software Foundations", U of Penn (CoQ basis)

### Workshops

* Dissect and learn thoroughly a particular useful library - lens, monocle, scalaz, shapeless, spire, Haskell prelude, etc.
* make the case - comparative anatomy, show exactly how FP solves a problem differently
* refactor existing imperative program to see difference

## Other Resources

Each group has been connected to a language-specific meetup locally.

* Universities - promote research, give grad students practice presenting
* Companies here that use FP currently in the Chicago area
  * Hearken doing Elm
  * Hashrocket uses Elixir (in part)
  * A Haskell blockchain company
  * Garrett Smith working on Tensor Flow in Erlang
  * Lightbend with Scala and Spark
* Slack or other communications channels
  * #fp on Chicago Tech Slack
  * #Chicago on Functional Programming Slack

## Questions

* Should / can separate Scala, Haskell, Elixir, FP, etc. groups be supported?
* Would a better grouping be Presentation, Paper Group, Workshop, Tutorial

# Some Other Groups and what They're Up To

* Sydney Type Theory: "Type Theory and Functional Programming" - 1999 book by Simon Thompson?
* Sydney Paper Club: "State machines all the way down" by Edwin Brady: paper on dependently-typed programming in Idris.

## Some Topics at Sydney Meetups

General background -

* "SBT plugins for no fun and little profit" by Tin Pavlinic: An overview of how SBT plugins work. Both for those who want to write plugins and those who just want to control their build better.
* "Combining Free and FreeAp in the wild" by Cameron Joannidis: A talk about using the Free Monad in the wild and how to introduce parallelism into your Free programs with FreeAp. Has a focus on practicality rather than type theory.
* "Functional Webapps with scalajs-react" by David Barri: scalajs-react is a Scala library that allows you to write webapps that remain easy and safe to dev / extend / maintain / reason-about as your project scales from toy -> real app -> behemoth.
* "Comonads in Anger" by Mark Hibberd: Monads get all the press, but they are a bit old hat, so in this talk we will look at its under-appreciated cousin, the Comonad, and how it relates to many useful FP concepts such as lenses, zippers and functional-reactive programming.
