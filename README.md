# CHIFP

## Where to continue the conversation

The #fp channel of the [Chicago Tech Slack](http://www.chicagotechslack.com/).

The #chicago channel of the [Functional Programming Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/).

If we reach a critical mass, we can discuss setting up a dedicated communications channel, but for now I'd like to leverage existing channels.

## Kick-off meeting agenda/notes

The [kick-off notes/agenda](kick-off-agenda-notes.md) that Greg put together are available. We'll add other notes as they come in. Alternatively, if you have your own notes you like to add, feel free! Just ping Hari or Andy for access.

### Notes from meetup
 * Thanks to Joel McCance for supplying [these notes](kick-off-notes.md).
