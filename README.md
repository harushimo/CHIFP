# CHIFP

## Where to continue the conversation

The #fp channel of the [Chicago Tech Slack](http://www.chicagotechslack.com/).

The #chicago channel of the [Functional Programming Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/).

If we reach a critical mass, we can discuss setting up a dedicated communications channel, but for now I'd like to leverage existing channels.

## Coverage
